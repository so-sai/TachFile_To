# RESEARCH_CANVAS.md - Vibe-Working Hub

This is the central hub for capturing and refining our "vibes" – the high-level intents and inspirations that drive VANTAGE development. Use this space to brainstorm, track agent tasks, and synthesize insights.

## Current Vibes

- **Spatial AI Orchestration:** Imagine agents as living entities in a 3D space, not flat tabs.
- **Truth Drift Prevention:** Ensure every AI action (like `document_lens` and `check_drift`) is auditable against human intent.
- **Universal Protocol:** VANTAGE should work seamlessly across domains – quantum, web, finance.

## Agent Tasks in Progress

- [x] Implement document_lens in vantage-core for Excel/Word parsing.
- [x] Design Manager View schema in vantage-view.
- [x] Audit and generalize vantage-core (Standardized to MCP 0.8.1).

## Insights and Reflections

- Rust's ownership model is perfect for modeling agent permissions and data flow.
- The **Universal Bridge** strategy ensures Vantage isn't siloed in one IDE.

## Future Directions

- Full 3D HUD rendering in WebGL.
- Explore AR/VR interfaces for true spatial collaboration.
