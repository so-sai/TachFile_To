# ⚠️ INVALID - TDD VIOLATION

**Status:** INVALID - PENDING DELETION  
**Reason:** Created BEFORE Test Contracts were signed (violates §1.3 TDD Enforcement)

---

This skeleton code was created prematurely without following TDD principles.

## What Happened

1. Code was written BEFORE test contracts existed
2. This violates Iron Core Policy §1.3
3. Code must be deleted or rewritten AFTER Red Phase

## Action Required

After Architect signs off on Test Contracts:
1. Delete this entire `libs/iron_python_bridge/` directory
2. Write failing tests first (Red Phase)
3. Write minimal code to pass tests (Green Phase)

> **Iron Core Rule:**  
> Test định nghĩa thực tại. Code chỉ là công cụ để thỏa mãn test.
