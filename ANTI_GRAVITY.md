# ANTI-GRAVITY PROJECT CONSTITUTION (2026)
## The Elite 9 Hybrid Architecture

### 1. FOUNDING PRINCIPLES
- **Precision Over Decoration**: Every UI element must serve a cognitive purpose.
- **Hybrid Domain Supremacy**: Use **Rust 1.92** for I/O and performance core; use **Python 3.14t (No-GIL)** for complex document AI (Docling).
- **Zero Ambiguity**: Financial and technical data must be presented with absolute clarity. No soft shadows, no blur, no unwrap.

### 2. CORE ENGINE: THE HYBRID BRIDGE
The project officially adopts a **Hybrid Architecture** to solve the Document Ingestion problem:
- **Fast Lane (Rust Native)**: Direct FS calls, Calamine Excel processing, and Polars 0.52 dataframe normalization.
- **Heavy Lane (Python Elite 9)**: Docling-based extraction running under the experimental **Python 3.14t (Free-threaded)** runtime.
- **The Bridge**: Powered by **PyO3 Git (0.27.x)** to overcome the "Hố tử thần" of early 3.14 support.

### 3. DESIGN SYSTEM: PRECISION BRUTALISM
- **Stroke Weight**: Primary borders set to **1.5px** for extreme precision.
- **Depth**: Using **Hard Shadows** (offset 4px, zero blur) to simulate architectural stacking.
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono for all numeric values (tabular alignment mandatory). Inter for cognitive readability.

### 4. GOVERNANCE
- **Source Control**: "Vô trùng" (Sterile) Repo. All third-party sources and build logs are strictly ignored.
- **Error Model**: No silent failures. Every Python exception MUST be caught, semantically wrapped, and reported to the Rust frontend.
